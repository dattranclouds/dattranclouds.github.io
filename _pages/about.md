Hello! I'm **Dat Tran**, a Solution Architect with over 8 years of experience in the IT industry. I'm a technology enthusiast at heart, and I believe that technology serves as nourishment for the intellect. I completed my Bachelor's degree at the Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City, and since then, I've been immersing myself in the world of technology.

As a Java Full-Stack and Mobile Engineer, I've had the opportunity to lead teams and work on a variety of projects. My expertise extends to cloud technology, where I've been able to leverage my skills as a Solution Architect.

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Cloud Technology and FullStack Developer" %}

This blog is my platform for marketing myself and sharing my knowledge with anyone interested in technology. Whether you're a fellow professional in the IT industry or a curious learner, I hope you'll find something of value here.

When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me indulging in my hobbies. I love playing football, traveling to new places, reading a good book, and enjoying music. My passion for technology and technical aspects of life drives me to continuously learn and grow.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me at [ttdat194@gmail.com](mailto:ttdat194@gmail.com) or give me a call at (+84) 389304752.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I look forward to sharing my journey with you!
